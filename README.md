# Pixee is your automated product security engineer

*Pixee fixes vulnerabilities, hardens code, squashes bugs, and gives
engineers more time to focus on the work that counts.*

The Pixee CLI brings the power of Pixee's [Codemodder framework](https://codemodder.io) to your local development environment. This provides a way for developers to try out Pixee before installing the GitHub app.

Learn more at https://pixee.ai! 

Get the most out of Pixee by installing the Pixeebot GitHub app at
https://app.pixee.ai. Or find us on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot). 

## Supported Systems:
* MacOS (using [homebrew](https://brew.sh))
* Linux (coming soon!)

## Installation

### MacOS (using homebrew)

```
brew tap pixee/pixee
brew install pixee
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the `pixee` command to see instructions and options. 

To simply scan some code and see possible changes to make:

```
pixee fix /my/project/directory/
```

## Docker Usage

Pixee can also be run in a Docker container. This is useful if you want to run Pixee on an operating system that does not support brew, or a CI/CD pipeline or in a containerized environment. 

```
docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}:/src" codemodder/pixee-cli fix /src

```

## F.A.Q.

### What languages are supported for fixes?
Currently we support codemods for Java and Python. Stay tuned for additional language support at https://pixee.ai!

### What happens to my code?
The Pixee CLI currently runs most detection and fixes locally to your own host machine. Any features that require network access to a third-party service (e.g. OpenAI) will require explicit opt-in. We promise to be transparent when this is the case. **Your code will not leave your host machine unless you explicitly opt-in to a feature that requires network access.**

### How can I install the GitHub application?
Get the most out of Pixee by installing the Pixeebot GitHub app at https://app.pixee.ai. Or find us on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot).

### Where can I request features and report issues?
For CLI feature requests and bug reports please use our GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/pixee/pixee-cli/issues
